                            </b><br>This agreement (including the General and Specific Terms set forth below)
                            contains all of the terms and conditions between USAWeb, USAWeb Powered Websites and Listing
                            Services, it's subsidiaries and divisions, USAWeb and you ("users") and governs the use of
                            the services offered at the USAWeb web sites ( the "site") . User's use of the Site
                            constitutes User's agreement to all terms and conditions in this Agreement.<br><br>

                            <b>General Terms</b><br>
                            USAWeb allows Users and Advertisers to connect. USAWeb is a communications platform for
                            enabling the connection between consumers ("users) and Advertisers offering services to
                            consumers. USAWeb does not have any control over the quality, timing, accuracy, or
                            legality of the advertisements submitted for display upon any of USAWeb sites. User
                            agrees not to hold USAWeb (or any of its agents or employees) liable for any advice or
                            services submitted or delivered by way of any of its web sites.<br><br>

                            <b>Transactions</b><br>Once user has accepted the terms of the services or conditions of the
                            item(s) for sale and payment has been made for said services or item(s), there is a
                            binding contract implicit between the User and the Advertiser. If there are any issues
                            with the service, items, or advice received or payment due, User must deal directly with
                            the advertiser to resolve any disputes. USAWeb will monitor the behavior of the User and
                            the Advertiser, ratings and comments and suspend privileges to any Users or Advertisers
                            not adhering to policies of the Site.<br><br>

                            <b>Community areas</b><br> If the Site contains bulletin board services, user submitted
                            classified ad areas, forums, or other types of communication facilities, User agrees to
                            use such community areas only to send and receive messages and material that are
                            relevant and proper to the applicable forum.<br><br>

                            USAWeb is only a communications platform which allows the connection between Users and
                            Advertisers. USAWeb does not take part in the interaction between Users and Advertisers
                            except to collect payment from Advertisers for delivering their services through the
                            Site. USAWeb does not have control over the legality, quality, or timeliness of the
                            services actually delivered by the Advertisers. USAWeb makes no representations about
                            the suitability, reliability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information, advice, or
                            services provided by Advertisers through the Site whether in public, private, or
                            off-line interactions.. Due to the nature of the Internet, USAWeb can not confirm that
                            each User or Advertiser is who they claim to be, however, USAWeb has established a
                            User-initiated feedback system to help Users evaluate Advertisers.<br><br>

                            <b>Billing and Payment Policy</b> <br>Users are obligated to pay when service is delivered
                            by
                            Advertisers, and/or when both the User and the Advertiser agree to the terms of the
                            agreement between the two parties. USAWeb is not obligated, under any circumstances, to
                            collect any fees or payments for either the User or the Advertiser.<br><br>

                            <b>No Liability</b><br> User agrees not to hold USAWeb liable for any service, advice, or
                            items
                            delivered which originated through the Site or otherwise was provided by an Advertiser.
                            User releases USAWeb from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of
                            every kind and nature, known, and unknown, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or
                            in any way connected with such disputes.<br><br>

                            <b>Community Areas </b><br>If the Site contains forums, bulletin boards, or any other
                            message or
